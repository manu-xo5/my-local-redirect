# my-local-redirect

This is alternate to your browsers default "new page". Every query is prefixed with "https://".

### Some frequent aliases:
...are already included and can be replaced.
- gh = github.com/
- yt = youtube.com/
- mail = mail.google.com/

### Can add your own redirects:
...by using ":add" prefix, e.g. ":add todo keep.google.com". These redirects will be saved in localstorage and might not presist throught browsers. Press 'Tab' to reveal the alias to full uri.
example
alias "eg" + 'Tab' = "example.com/". Now you can append something like "user/1" to login with 2nd account.

for google, query-link = "www.google.com/search?q=<query-here>"
